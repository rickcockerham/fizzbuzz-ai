This is my example code project.  It's a Ruby and C program that learns the Fizz Buzz problem.   Fizz Buzz is a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 and for multiples of '3' print 'Fizz' instead of the number and for the multiples of '5' print 'Buzz' and multiples of both '3' and '5' print 'FizzBuzz'

I realize this problem is extremely easy to solve and there is a lot of information on how to solve it efficiently, but I decided to do it the hard way.  This program lets a neural network learn the solution.

I wrote the neural network code in C and the web interface in Ruby on Rails.  The working example can be viewed here http://ai-stocktrading.com:81
If that weird port number scares your browser please let me know.

This program shows my skill with the following technologies:
Ruby on Rails (2.5.3, 6.0.7)
C (posix)
Machine Learning (a simple backpropagating, gradient descent, neural network)
RubyC (A system to make C methods available in Ruby.)

The example was deployed to a linode.com node.  However, I have also worked with Rackspace, Google, Linode, and AWS.
Apache
Passenger
iptables (do you feel lucky, punk?  Go ahead, check my ports.)
